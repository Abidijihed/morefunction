//1.Write a JavaScript program to check whether a given positive number is a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 7.
function name(){

}
//2.Write a JavaScript program to replace every character in a given string with the character following it in the alphabet.
function LetterChanges(){

}
//3.Write a JavaScript program to capitalize the first letter of each word of a given string.

}
//4.Write a JavaScript program to check whether 1 appears in first or last position of a given array of integers. The array length must be greater or equal to 1.
function first_last_1()
{
  
}

//5. Write a JavaScript program to find the number of sorted pairs formed by its elements of a given array of integers such that one element in the pair is divisible by the other one.

// For example - The output of [1, 3, 2] ->2 - (1,3), (1,2).
// The output of [2, 4, 6] -> 2 - (2,4), (2,6)
// The output of [2, 4, 16] -> 3 - (2,4), (2,16), (4,16)
function arr_pairs() {
}
//6. Write a JavaScript program to check whether a matrix is a diagonal matrix or not. In linear algebra, a diagonal matrix is a matrix in which the entries outside the main diagonal are all zero (the diagonal from the upper left to the lower right).

// Example:
// [1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 3] ]) = true
// [1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 3], [0, 0, 3] ]) = false
